•	Select user stories for the sprint based on team capacity.
•	Define Objectives:
•	Clearly outline the objectives and goals for the project.
•	Identify key features to be implemented during each sprint.
### 2. Development Sprints:
    •	Sprint Execution:
    •	Daily Stand-ups: Hold daily stand-up meetings for the development team to discuss progress, challenges, and plans.
    •	Develop and test features incrementally during the sprint.
    •	Use version control (Git) for collaborative development.
    •	Continuous Integration:
    •	Integrate code changes frequently to ensure that the application is always in a working state.
    •	Automated testing should be a part of the integration process.
### 3. Review and Retrospective:
    •	Sprint Review:
        •	At the end of each sprint, conduct a sprint review to showcase completed features to stakeholders.
        •	Collect feedback for potential adjustments.
        •	Sprint Retrospective:
    •	Reflect on the sprint, discussing what went well, what could be improved, and what actions to take in the next sprint.
### 4. Backlog Refinement:
    •	User Story Refinement:
        •	Regularly refine and update the product backlog.
        •	Break down large user stories into smaller, manageable tasks.
### 5. Continuous Testing:
    •	Automated Testing:
        •	Implement automated testing to ensure the reliability of the application.
        •	Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests should be part of the testing strategy.
### 6. Deployment:
    •	Staging Deployment:
        •	Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing.
        •	Conduct acceptance testing with stakeholders.
        •	Production Deployment:
        •	If testing is successful, deploy the application to the production environment.
### 7. Feedback and Iteration:
•	Gather Feedback:
•	Collect feedback from end-users during and after deployment.
•	Use feedback to prioritize features for the next sprints.
•	Iteration:
•	Based on feedback and changing requirements, iterate on the product backlog.
•	Adjust the development plan for upcoming sprints.
### 8. Documentation:
•	User Documentation:
•	Prepare user manuals and documentation for both administrators and end-users.
•	Keep documentation up-to-date with each release.
•	Technical Documentation:
•	Document the codebase, APIs, and any technical aspects for future reference.
### 9. Security and Performance:
•	Security Measures:
•	Regularly assess and update security measures.
•	Address any security vulnerabilities promptly.
•	Performance Optimization:
•	Continuously optimize the application for performance.
•	Monitor and address any performance bottlenecks.
### 10. Collaboration and Communication:
•	Regular Meetings:
•	Conduct regular sprint planning, review, and retrospective meetings.
•	Maintain open communication channels within the team.
•	Tools:
•	Use collaboration tools (e.g., Jira or Trello for project management, Slack for communication).
•	Version control tools like Git for collaborative development.
### 11. Scale and Future Enhancements:
•	Scalability:
•	Ensure the system can handle a growing number of users and events.
•	Future Enhancements:
•	Plan for potential future enhancements based on user feedback and emerging requirements.
•	Consider additional features for scalability and user satisfaction.
### 12. Continuous Improvement:
•	Retrospectives:
•	Regularly review and improve the development process.
•	Adjust the SDLC based on the team's evolving needs.
### 13. User Training:
•	Training Sessions:
